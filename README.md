This is the final project for Group 3 in the “Object-Oriented Programming” course (113th academic year), based on the Python remake of Plants vs. Zombies by https://github.com/wszqkzqk/pypvz. 

We’ve customized it with the following enhancements:

 1. Background and Character Customization:
 
    Backgrounds are now meme-filled, and some zombies have been reimagined as TA-themed characters.

    *Special thanks to our TA for the cameo appearance!*

 2. Survival Game Mode Implementation:
 
    Instead of the original "Nut Bowling" level, we implemented a survival mode where players face endless waves of zombies until defeat. 
    
    Difficulty gradually increases over time.

 3. Full User Interface Flow:
 
    The game now features a fully integrated flow: start screen → gameplay → leaderboard → return to start

 4. Leaderboard System:
 
    A local leaderboard records and ranks player performance based on two metrics:

    Total survival time and total kill points of zombies eliminated (different zombies gains different kill points).

 5. Online Play Feature:
 
    The game is playable online via Replit—jump in and test your survival skills!

To run the game, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python main.py
```
