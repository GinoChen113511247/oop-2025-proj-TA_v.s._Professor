This is the final project for Group 3 in the “Object-Oriented Programming” course (113th academic year), based on the Python remake of Plants vs. Zombies by https://github.com/wszqkzqk/pypvz. 

We’ve customized it with the following enhancements:

 1. TA Character Customization:
 
    Replace some zombie characters with TA-themed versions.
    *Special thanks to our TA for the cameo appearance!*

 2. Survival game mode implementation:
 
    Instead of the original "Nut Bowling" level, we implemented a survival mode where players face endless waves of zombies until defeat. Difficulty gradually increases over time.

 3. Full user interface flow:
 
    The game now features a fully integrated flow: start screen → gameplay → leaderboard → return to start

 4. Leaderboard System:
 
    A local leaderboard records and ranks player performance based on two metrics:
    Total survival time and total kill points of zombies eliminated (different zombies gains different kill points).

To run the game, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
