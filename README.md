This is the final project for Group 3 in the “Object-Oriented Programming” course (113th academic year), based on the Python remake of Plants vs. Zombies by wszqkzqk/pypvz. 

We’ve customized it with the following enhancements:

 1. TA Character Customization
    Replace some plant/zombie characters with TA-themed versions, complete with new visuals and stats.

 2. Custom Movement Patterns
    Add varied movement behaviors to increase gameplay challenge and variety.

 3. New Special Tools & Characters
    Introduce features like “Freeze Bombs” and other strategic tools to enrich gameplay.

 4. Adjustable Difficulty Levels
    Dynamically tweak zombie spawn rates, HP, types, etc., via configurable level parameters for better balance and engagement.
